# Projects

Similar to Bulbapedia or Steam Grid DB, we have a projects program which highlights areas that need work on the wiki.

Contributing to any of the projects will net you **a nifty little participation badge** in the [SBHAX Discord](https://discord.gg/KGWgnAw) and a **sleek wiki contributor role**.

## Project Archive

*Badge: Purple*

Project Archive is the biggest one of them all and is the only one that doesn't directly require contribution to the wiki.

People contributing to Project Archive are looking for existing information in the Discord and working against the clock to get them stored away and archived somewhere to be read and put into the wiki.

## Project Stages

*Badge: Blue*

Project Stages is dedicated to documenting all the details about stages in the game, to the specification of [Emerald Beach](?a=stages/emeraldbeach) and a bit more. A good quality stage page lists:

- Slot

- Width

- Height

- Selectability

- Graphics locations

- Palette locations

- Layout locations

People contributing to Project Stages are interested in the cutting edge and are looking to find out more about the game.

## Project Characters

*Badge: Aqua*

Project Characters is devoted to enhancing character pages with harder to find information. This includes internal character slots, graphics, palettes and more.

People contributing to Project Characters are those looking to expand upon the most highlighted aspect of the scene, using existing information to fill in gaps.
