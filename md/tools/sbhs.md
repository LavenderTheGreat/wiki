Sonic Battle Hack Suite is a hack tool created by Phase, initially released in 2015. It is largely still regarded as an essential tool for efficiently modding the game and for beginners. It requires Java or an equivalent (ie OpenJDK) to run.

## Editors

SBHS as the name implies contains multiple editors as part of it's full suite, these are listed below.

### Palette Editor

</p>

SBHS has a rudimentary palette editor that allows you to export and reimport palettes in the format of a 1x16 png, or use buttons to colour pick them.

### Story Editor

</p>

SBHS also contains a story editor, which allows you to edit the text content of stories in the game. It is preferable to use Porog's [Sonic Battle Text Editor](?a=tools/sonicbattletexteditor) instead, as the SBHS version does not reallocate space, causing line overflows and similar glitches.

### Sprite Editor

    <i>SBHS' sprite editor.</i>
</p>

The sprite editor is largely deemed the main attraction of SBHS, as it's extremely reliable, accessible and robust. It features simple palette editting through a palette in the corner of the sheet and visible sprite boundaries. It also displays unused sprite tiles, which can be used for adding extra frames.

### Effect Editor

</p>

This is similar to the sprite editor, but instead focuses on effects. It may be more reliable to use a tool like [GBAGE](?a=tools/gbage) to edit the effect sprites instead.
